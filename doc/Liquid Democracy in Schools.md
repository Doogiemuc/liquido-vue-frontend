# Liquid Democracy in Schools

# Mobil Web Frontend for children

A Robot talks in a chat with a pupil:

L: Hey there! My name is LIQUIDO! What's your first name?

M: Mary

L: Hey Mary! Nice to meet you. Do you want to play a game with me
   and your friends?

M: Yes

L: We'll play a voting game.

M: What is 'voting'?   => (01)
M: Sure, let's go.     => (02)


### (01)
L: Imagine that you and your friends want to decide what to do tomorrow.
   Then you most likely will simply talk to each other.

   But what if you'd need to come to a decision with a large group,
   for example everyone in your school.
   In this case you could run a vote. Everyone casts a secret vote for
   one or more proposals. When the poll is finished there will be
   one winning proposal.


### (02)
L: What do you want to run a vote vor?
L: <title of poll>

L: Great. Please send this link to your friends. Then they
   can suggest proposals:
   <http short link for friends>
