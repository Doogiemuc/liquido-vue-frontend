# liquido-vue-frontend

> Frontend for my liquid democracy app written with Vue 2.0 

Liquido - a modern aproach for interactive, representative and direct democracy.

Liquid Democracy or Proxy Voting is a modern variant of direct demorcacy. Voters cast their votes for polls, just as you do it today. But a voter can also delegate his vote to a proxy. Then the proxy votes for him. A proxy may accumulate multiple delegated votes. This is what political parties do in today's democracy. But in Liquid Democracy, a voter may revoke his delegation at any time. A voter may simply decide to vote for himself per every poll. A voter may also decide to delegate his vote to another proxy at any time. Not just every four years.



# Liquido Architecture

![Liquido Architecture](./doc/Liquido Architecture.png)

See [liquido-backend-spring](https://github.com/Doogiemuc/liquido-backend-spring) for the backend implementation.

This is my playground for learning the client side Java script framework [Vue 2.0](https://vuejs.org). Meanwhile this grew to a medium sized "single page application" (SPA) with quite some nice features.

## Dependencies / Technical tools used

 * [Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/) - Client side MVC JS lib (comparable to AngularJS but different :-)
 * [Vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader) Load components from .vue files
 * [Vue-router](http://router.vuejs.org/) - URL navigation for single page applications
 * Based on the [Vue Webpack Boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) project template
 * Of course see [package.json](https://github.com/Doogiemuc/liquido-vue-frontend/blob/master/package.json) for full details
 
## Features

 * HTML, JS and CSS is packed and bundeld with Webpack
 * Local client side caching in the SPA
 * Clean API client for REST full backend
 * A powerfull homebrew Vue Table component with filtering, sorting and pagination
 * Tests, tests and more tests.  I am a big fan of TDD!

## Build Setup

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps

- `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - All static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and a production `index.html` is auto-generated with proper URLs to these generated assets.

- `npm run smoke`: Very fast smoke tests written with Jasmine.
  - No browser involed, but blazingly fast.

- `npm run unit`: Unit tests run in PhantomJS with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) + [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [karma-webpack](https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack).
  - Supports ES2015 in test files.
  - Supports all webpack loaders.
  - Easy mock injection.

- `npm run e2e`: End-to-end tests with [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/).
  - Run tests in multiple browsers in parallel.
  - Works with one command out of the box:
    - Selenium and chromedriver dependencies automatically handled.
    - Automatically spawns the Selenium server.
